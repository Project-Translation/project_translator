The Midnight Code

Sarah's fingers danced across the keyboard, her eyes fixed on the countless lines of code scrolling past. The office was dark, lit only by the pale glow of her monitor. It was 2 AM, but she was close to a breakthrough.

"Just one more bug to fix," she whispered to herself, taking another sip of her now-cold coffee. The security system she was developing had to be perfect â€“ lives depended on it.

Suddenly, her screen flickered. A pattern emerged in the chaos of numbers and symbols. Something she had never seen before. The code wasn't just working; it was evolving.

As dawn approached, Sarah realized she hadn't just fixed a bug. She had discovered something that would change everything.
