In realms of thought, where dreams reside,
A symphony of colors, side by side.
Whispers of wind, a gentle breeze,
Dancing through leaves of ancient trees.

Sunlight paints the morning dew,
A canvas bright, forever new.
Stars ignite the velvet night,
Guiding souls with their gentle light.

In every heart, a story untold,
A tapestry of moments, brave and bold.
Embrace the journey, let your spirit soar,
For life's a poem, forevermore.
